#Analyzing Data in a Model Car Database with MySQL Workbench

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of the Mint Classics Company's database, focusing on inventory management, customer behavior, and sales performance. The database models the operations of a classic model car retailer, and the analysis was conducted using MySQL Workbench.

##Project Overview

Mint Classics is considering the closure of one of its storage facilities while maintaining customer service standards. This analysis explores product sales, inventory turnover, and warehouse utilization to provide data-driven recommendations for optimizing inventory and improving customer retention.

###Key Objectives:

- Identify underperforming products that should be discontinued.
- Suggest which warehouse facility should be closed based on inventory and sales data.
- Analyze customer behavior and suggest strategies for improving retention.
- Evaluate the performance of sales representatives.

##Key Findings:

- ** Warehouse Optimization:** Warehouse D, with the lowest stock and turnover, is a candidate for closure, while Warehouse B holds the most stock and customers.
- ** Product Performance:** Certain products like the 1985 Toyota Supra are slow-moving and should be discontinued, while high-demand items such as the 1968 Ford Mustang should be prioritized for restocking.
- ** Customer Retention:** High-value customers, including Euro+ Shopping Channel, should be the focus of retention efforts. Additionally, geographic expansion opportunities exist in regions like Tokyo and Sydney.
- ** Sales Rep Performance:** Some sales reps excel in generating revenue, while others may require training to improve customer management and sales.

##Skills Demonstrated:

- ** SQL Query Writing:** Crafting complex SQL queries to extract insights from multiple relational database tables.
- ** Data Aggregation and Analysis:** Analyzing product, customer, and sales data to identify trends and actionable insights.
- ** Inventory and Customer Retention Analysis:** Performing detailed analysis to inform business strategy.
- ** Data-Driven Recommendations:** Providing actionable recommendations for warehouse optimization and customer retention based on the analysis.
