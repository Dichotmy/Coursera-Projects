# IBM Data Science Capstone

This folder contains the capstone project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. The capstone represents the culmination of the skills and knowledge I acquired throughout the course.

## Project Overview

### **Objective**

The objective of this capstone project was to solve a real-world data problem using the tools and techniques learned in the IBM Data Science Certificate program.

### **Dataset**

- **Source:** The dataset is a sample of Space X Falcon 9 launches from 2010 to 2020 extracted from the Space X API 'https://api.spacexdata.com'.
- **Content:** The dataset contains various attributes includeing, launch locations, booster versions, timestamps, and achieved orbits.

### **Approach**
